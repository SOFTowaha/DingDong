You can grab it at the link below, but here's how to "install" it in Google Documents:

    * Open Google Drive in a browser and open any document.
    * Click the Tools menu, then select Script Editor.
    * Click Close on the pop-up tutorial window, and delete the starter text.
    * Open Renato's script in another tab, and copy the contents. Paste them into the script editor.
    * Click File and Save to save the script. Give it a name, like "ConvertToMarkdown."

Now your script is saved, and you can run it anytime you like. To run it against a Google Document, just open that document, click Tools, then select "Script Manager." You'll see your script in the list. Select it, and then click "Run."

That's all there is to it. The script is especially useful if you're looking to export Google Documents in a format that can easily be imported somewhere else (like GitHub, for example) or converted into another format (like HTML) later. Hit the link below to grab the script yourself, and read more about which formats it's able to interpret and convert.
